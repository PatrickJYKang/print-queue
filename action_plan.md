# Action Plan

**Learning goal:** to learn and explore how to connect and talk with printers and how to build a sensible queue system for them that is usable and fair for all users.

**Action goal:** build a queue system for 3× Bambu Lab X1C printers via Discord not using manual monitor. Anyone using the tool can (has to) join the queue and claim a printer to start printing. The queue is fair and automated.

**Technical notes:** see [technical.md](technical.md).
